## Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry

Welcome to the Telecom Customers Churn Prediction project. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of machine learning classifiers and their application in the telecom industry.

**Objectives of this project:**

1. Develop a strong theoretical foundation and intuitive understanding of machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.

2. Gain proficiency in evaluating and comparing trained models by utilizing metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score and visualizing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

3. Acquire hands-on experience in training various classifier models using the Scikit-Learn library, a powerful tool in the field of machine learning.
